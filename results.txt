    [Evidence(content="The sky appears blue due to Rayleigh scattering, a phenomenon where sunlight interacts with Earth's atmosphere. Sunlight, though appearing white, is composed of various colors, each with different wavelengths. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, it collides with gas molecules like nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter shorter wavelengths of light—blue and violet—more than longer wavelengths like red and yellow. Despite violet light being scattered even more than blue, our eyes are more sensitive to blue, and some of the violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere, making the sky predominantly blue to our perception.
