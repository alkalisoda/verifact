    [Evidence(content='Grass is typically green due to the presence of chlorophyll, a pigment essential for photosynthesis. Chlorophyll absorbs blue and red light, reflecting green wavelengths, which gives grass its characteristic color. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\n\n- **Chlorophyll\'s Role in Photosynthesis:**\n  Chlorophyll is a pigment found in the chloroplasts of plant cells. It absorbs blue and red light, reflecting green wavelengths, which gives grass its characteristic color. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Grass Green Color Definition:**\n  The term "grass green" refers to a strong yellowish-green color, averaging a hue that is yellower and duller than shamrock green or Cyprus green. ([merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grass%20green?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Neutral Evidence:**\n\n- **Variations in Grass Color:**\n  Grass color can vary based on species, environmental conditions, and health.
